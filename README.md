# AWS Static Website Hosting with Terraform

This project sets up a static website hosted on Amazon S3, with global content delivery configured via AWS CloudFront and DNS management through AWS Route 53. The infrastructure is provisioned and managed using Terraform, which ensures a reproducible and maintainable environment.

## Project Components

- **Amazon S3**: Hosts static website content across two geographic regions (East and West).
- **AWS CloudFront**: Distributes the website content globally to reduce latency and improve load times.
- **AWS Route 53**: Manages DNS records to ensure the domain points to the CloudFront distribution.
- **AWS Certificate Manager**: Provides SSL/TLS certificates to secure website access.
- **Terraform**: Automates the provisioning and updating of resources.

## Directory Structure

```

|- main.tf           # Main Terraform configuration file with resource definitions.
|- variables.tf      # Variable definitions for Terraform.
|- outputs.tf        # Output configurations for Terraform.
|- README.md         # This documentation file.
```

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: You need to have an AWS account set up.
- **Terraform Installed**: Ensure you have Terraform v1.0.0 or higher installed on your machine.
- **AWS CLI**: Optionally installed for configuring AWS credentials and interacting with AWS services directly.

## Configuration

1. **AWS Credentials**: Set up your AWS credentials as environment variables:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key_here"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_access_key_here"
   ```

2. **Terraform Initialization**: Run the following command to initialize Terraform, which will download the necessary providers.

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Customize Variables**: Modify the `variables.tf` file to suit your region preferences and resource names.

## Deployment

To deploy the infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. **Plan**: Execute the following command to see the actions Terraform will perform:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

2. **Apply**: If the plan looks good, apply the configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

3. **Verify**: After deployment, visit your domain in a web browser to see the deployed website.

## Maintenance and Updates

To update your infrastructure, modify the Terraform configurations as needed and re-run `terraform apply` to apply the changes.

## Destroy

To tear down the infrastructure and delete all resources, run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.
